# chat_with_me
A software so my descendants can chat with me

The general idea is to create a number of bots that can run in a decentralized way,
and build a the system that will respond to the chat

Every bot should:
- get the next available node from a store
- process that node (should processing destroy the node and create a new one?)
- save the result to another node in a store
